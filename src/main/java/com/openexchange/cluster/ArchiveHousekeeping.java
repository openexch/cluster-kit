/**
 * Reclaims the Assets Engine's archive disk after cluster snapshots.
 *
 * Aeron snapshots do NOT truncate the cluster log — they only ADD recordings
 * (consensus module state + service state) plus a recording.log entry. Disk
 * reclamation is a separate, explicit archive operation, and until this class
 * existed the AE had none: its log grew forever. On 2026-07-25 that filled
 * /dev/shm, the archive began failing writes with "No space left on device",
 * AE nodes terminated, the settlement bridge could no longer map a journal
 * replay image, and the money path stopped for seventeen hours. A bigger box
 * only moves that day further out. This is what removes it.
 *
 * What it does: purge whole log segment files below the latest valid snapshot
 * position (recovery = latest snapshot + log replay from its position, so the
 * log below that point is never needed by this node again).
 *
 * Snapshot recordings themselves are deliberately NOT purged: Aeron recovery
 * selects the snapshot to replay by the recording.log {@code isValid} flag without
 * checking the archive, so purging a recording while its recording.log entry remains
 * valid breaks recover-from-snapshot ("unknown recording id"). Snapshot recordings are
 * tiny (serialized state); the reclaimable disk is the log segments. A post-run check
 * verifies every referenced snapshot recording still resolves in the archive.
 *
 * Must run against each node's own archive. Operational caveats (document,
 * don't discover): a member that was offline during the snapshot cannot
 * log-catch-up across purged segments and must be reseeded from a snapshot.
 * This is match#35 and it applies here identically — NEVER housekeep while a
 * member is down, lagging, or recovering.
 *
 * Ported from the matching engine's tool (match-cluster) rather than shared:
 * the logic is pure Aeron (RecordingLog + AeronArchive) with nothing
 * engine-specific, and the AE must not take a compile dependency on
 * match-cluster. Keep the two in step when either changes.
 *
 * Loud-limits principle: every action and every skipped action is reported.
